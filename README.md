###BOXPLOTS_3.R###                               an R script for automating the production ofboxplots to quickly examine RNAseq expression patterns for a  list of genes of interest. It uses:
  MERGED_1.csv (here as a .zip file):     sample data, of genes and tpm/exxression values
   Lignin_TF_anno_2.csv:                  a list of genes (here as LOC codes)  to filter MERGED_1
